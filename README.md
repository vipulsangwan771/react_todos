# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react_todos.git
    cd react_todos
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Backend
    cd server
    npm install

    # Frontend
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**

    Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally, or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

4. **Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with your MongoDB connection string:**

    ```ini
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```

5. **Run the servers:**

    ```bash
    # Backend
    cd ../server
    npm start

    # Frontend
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

6. **Open the app in your browser:**

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## 🔍 How It Works

- **Backend:** Express server powered with Socket.io and MongoDB manages todos and broadcasts realtime updates.  
- **Frontend:** React app listens to Socket.io events to update the todo list instantly across clients.  
- **Data:** Todos are persisted in MongoDB, providing reliable data storage and retrieval.  
- **Notifications:** React-toastify triggers instant feedback messages on todo actions like adding, updating, or deleting.
